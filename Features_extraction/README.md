Multiple feature extraction algorithms are used.

# I. Interest point detection algorithms

Interest point detection algorithms focus on finding distinctive points that are easy to match across images.

- **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), 1999**

SIFT first applies a convolution to all the images, with different Gaussian kernels, using different scales $\sigma_n = k^n \sigma_0$ (usually $k=\sqrt{2}$). If $I(x,y)$ is the original image and $G(x,y,\sigma)$ is the Gaussian function, then the blurred version of the image can be thus defined as:

$$L(x,y,\sigma) = G(x,y,\sigma) * I(x,y)$$

The **Difference of Gaussians (DoG)** is then computed by subtracting images from two consecutive scales:

$$D(x,y,\sigma) = L(x,y,k\sigma) - L(x,y,\sigma)$$

Key points are defined as local extrema in the DoG images. To find them, each pixel in a DoG image is compared to its 26 neighbors: 8 pixels from the same image, 9 pixels in the previous scale and 9 pixels in the next scale. It is considered a key point if this point is an extremum in this neighborhood. Some techniques are also used afterwards to remove some unstable or weak keypoints such as the one along edges.

Once the key points are detected, **descriptors** are created to describe them and so that they can be matched across different images. To define them, for each pixel belonging to a $16 \times 16$ grid around a key point, are first computed the gradient magnitude $M$ and orientation $\theta$ using finite differences. If we define $G_x = L(x+1,y) - L(x-1,y)$ the gradient in X direction, and $G_y = L(x,y+1) - L(x,y-1)$, then they can defined as:

$$M(x,y) = \sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2} ; \theta(x,y) = tan^{-1} (\frac{G_y}{G_x})$$

The $16 \times 16$ grid is divided into 16 smaller $4 \times 4$ cells so that each $4 \times 4$ region has its own orientation histogram, each containing 8 orientation bins. Therefore, each cell gives 8 orientation bins, and consequently the key point descriptor contains $8 \times 16 = 128$ values. 


- **ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF), 2011**

ORB is a fast and free **alternative to SIFT and SURF**. It uses the **FAST algorithm** to detect keypoints. FAST identifies corners by analyzing around each pixel a small circular neighborhood of 16 pixels. If $N$ ($N = 9$ typically) contiguous pixels in the circle are all darker or brighter by a threshold compared to a pixel, then the pixel is considered a corner. FAST is efficient as instead of checking all pixels in the circle, it first checks if 4 of these pixels meet the condition, and if it is the case, the entire circle is checked.

# II. Edge detection algorithms

Edge detection algorithms focus on identifying object boundaries where there are significant changes in intensity. These methods help extract key features from images. Edge detection can be divided into **gradient-based methods** and **second derivative methods**.

## 1. Gradient-Based Edge Detectors

Gradient-based methods compute the **first derivative** of the image to detect areas of high intensity change. They are **effective at finding edges** but tend to be **sensitive to noise**.

- **Canny Edge Detector (1986)**

The **Canny Edge Detector** is a popular method for detecting edges. It first applies **Gaussian smoothing** to reduce noise. Then, it computes the **image gradient** to find intensity changes. After that, **non-maximum suppression** is used to thin the edges. Finally, a **double thresholding** step classifies edges as strong or weak, and weak edges connected to strong ones are preserved.

- **Sobel Operator (1968)**

The **Sobel operator** highlights edges by applying horizontal and vertical filters to detect changes in intensity. 

The gradient magnitude is computed as $$G=\sqrt{G_x^2+G_y^2}$$ where $G_x$ and $G_y$ are gradients computed using Sobel kernels:

$$G_x =
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 1 \\
-2 & 0 & 2 \\
-1 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
, \quad
G_y =
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & -2 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 2 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$$

The Sobel operator is computationally **efficient and simple** but **sensitive to noise**, making it less reliable in high-noise environments.

- **Prewitt Operator (1970)**

The **Prewitt operator** is similar to Sobel but uses equal weights in the convolution kernels: 

$$G_x =
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 1 \\
-1 & 0 & 1 \\
-1 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
, \quad
G_y =
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & -1 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$$

It detects edges effectively but is slightly less accurate in identifying sharp intensity changes.

- **Scharr Operator (2000)**

The **Scharr operator** is an optimized version of Sobel that **reduces noise sensitivity** while maintaining sharp edge detection by improving **gradient estimation accuracy**. The convolution kernels are: 

$$G_x =
\begin{bmatrix}
-3 & 0 & 3 \\
-10 & 0 & 10 \\
-3 & 0 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
, \quad
G_y =
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & 10 & 3 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
-3 & -10 & -3
\end{bmatrix}$$


- **Roberts Cross Operator (1963)**

The **Roberts operator** detects edges by calculating the difference between diagonally adjacent pixels. 

$$G_x =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
, \quad
G_y =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1  \\
-1 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}$$

It is **simple and fast** but not as precise as more advanced techniques due to its **high sensitive to noise**.


## 2. Second-Derivative Edge Detectors

Second-derivative methods compute the **Laplacian**, which highlights regions of **rapid intensity change.**

- **Laplacian Operator**

The **Laplacian operator** detects edges by computing the **second derivative** of the image, which enhances areas of rapid intensity change. The Laplacian Kernel is:

$$L =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & -4 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}$$


## 3. Adaptive Edge Detection Techniques

These methods adapt thresholding techniques to improve edge detection in complex scenarios.

- **Adaptive Thresholding**

Adaptive thresholding dynamically adjusts threshold values based on **local intensity variations**, improving edge segmentation, especially in images with **non-uniform lighting conditions**.

- **Local Binary Patterns (LBP)**

LBP is used for texture-based edge analysis. It encodes pixel intensity variations in a small neighborhood, making it useful for capturing edge and texture information simultaneously.
